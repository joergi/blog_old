# my digital brain
as I don't wanna search for always the same stuff again and again, I started blogging on joergi77.wordpress.com     
but now I moved everything from there to https://joergi.github.io

### start locally:
rename `RENAME_docker-compose.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`     
you have to change add the JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN to the right one.    
the file is in `.gitignore`     
if it want's to upload it, make an `git rm --cached docker-compose.yml`

```
docker-compose up
```
